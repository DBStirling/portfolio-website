                            Although useful in limited quantities, barcode scanning becomes tedious in grocery stores as it requires the user to individually locate the barcode on each boxed item. Similarly, the limited databases of competitors reduce their soliution's overall utility as the app cannot be confidently and consistently used.

                            <body>
                                We discussed building an AI Recipe book that generates recipes based on a user's unique dietary profileand considered designing a web extension to confirm the safety of upcoming purchases. We even discussed creating an UberEats plugin of sorts to filter nearby restaurants by the quality of available food options. 
                                <br><br>
                                Alhough neither of these ideas werre used in their original form, they each found their way into the design of our solution. For example, our DietMe box-acanning feature is powered by scraping data from online stores such as UberEats, InstaCart, Walmart and more. We then built on this concept by suggesting recipes to users based on their scanning history and their grocery list. Additionally, the grocery list feature improved the utility of the application for a greater variety of users.

However, as DietMe stores this information in its databases, voice control will enable users to shop without relying on a second party to read items aloud. <br><br>This feature would need to be paired with haptic feedback for the incorrect scanning of items and would require much more intensive accessibility research to ensure the accessibility of the product.</body>
