                    Who am I?
                </div>
                <body>I’m a first-year student at the University of Waterloo studying Systems Design Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I’m interested in how technology intersects with society and how good design, although unnoticeable at times, can make foreign and innovative solutions feel like a natural fit. 
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve been designing as a means of problem solving for long as I can remember, founding a graphic design business in the thick of the pandemic, working as a product designer for a non-profit and engineering a handful of side projects along the way. I am client-oriented and driven by experiences. I believe that the best solutions are found when you pair a strong understanding of the problem and its affected users with an optimistic and personal approach to design. </body>
