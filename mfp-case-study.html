                        <body>Despite being disliked by users, paywalling key features works. It helped increase the percentage of users on premium plan subscriptions and contributed to a 25% year-on-year increase in revenue. 
                            <br><br>
                            Instead of reversing these changes, we can make the user experience more satisfying by implementing design changes that are inspired by newly identified pain points.
                            <br><br>
                            Ultimately, revenue can always be driven by providing value to the user. Designing around the user’s pain points will improve utility and drive both daily users and premium plan subscriptions as the app is in the hands of more happy users.</body>
